# React-Redux-Sample

A simple React-Redux project to demonstrate the basic flow of Redux with actions and store updates.

## Features
- **INCREMENT** – Increases the count
- **DECREMENT** – Decreases the count
- Uses **Redux** for state management
- Simple and beginner-friendly

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/React-Redux-Sample.git
   cd React-Redux-Sample
 
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   

3. Start the development server:
   npm start
   
## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:


"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
  "react-redux": "^8.0.0",
  "redux": "^4.0.0",
  "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.9.0"
}
## How It Works
1. **Actions:** Define `INCREMENT` and `DECREMENT` actions.
2. **Reducer:** Updates the state based on the action type.
3. **Store:** Centralized state management using Redux.
4. **Component:** Connects to the Redux store and dispatches actions.
